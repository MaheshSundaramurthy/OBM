== Admin interfaces

=== Prerequisite: Grant Rights to the Admin Profile

In order to access the *IMAP Archive* pages, you have to give extra rights to the *OBM* domain administrators.

To grant all rights on +domains+ to an *OBM* domain administrator, you have to
modify +Admin+ user's profile.

To achieve this, authenticate with the *OBM* web interface as an +Admin+ for the
global domain (like +admin0+), click on +Administration+, +User profiles+ then
update the +Admin+ profile. +
There is a +Specific settings+ section where you can give all rights on the +domains+ line.


=== General information

The goal of this feature is to provide archived IMAP folders to users. Those folders represent an image of the user IMAP folders grouped by year.
Users can only read those folders, and so will not be able to add, delete or perform any non-read action on them.

The process will not modify users' emails, users are still responsible on taking care of their quotas.

When the configuration is disable, no archive will be produce by the scheduler; and manual launch will not be available.

The scheduling configuration determines the eligible emails to archive. 
In other words, when you are setting the repeat kind:

 * to daily (time selection): each emails older than one day will be archived
 * to monthly (day of month and time selection): each emails older than one month will be archived +
 Example: current date is 11-25-2014, day of month is set to 5 and time is set to 21:30 +
 next run will be 12-05-2014 21:30, and every emails older than 11-05-2014 will be archived.
 * ...
